        <p> Microprocessors from Intel and Altera have been used to fabricate a MEMS device. The endoscopic probe, for example, contains MEMS microelectronics (diodes, capacitors, resistors and radio transmitters) and would take advantage of MEMS logic in the deviceâ€™s field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to perform its function. Wafer-level components have also been used as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, even in displays. </p>
